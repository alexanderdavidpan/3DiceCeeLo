<h1>3 Dice Cee-Lo</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Cee-lo is a multiplayer gambling game played with three six-sided dice. The objective of the game is to roll the highest scoring combination relative to everyone else's rolls.</p>

<h2>Possible Outcomes</h2>
<p>The order of possible outcomes from each dice roll are listed below from highest to lowest.</p>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>4-5-6</strong></dt>
		<dd>The highest possible roll.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Trips</strong></dt>
		<dd>Rolling three of the same number is known as rolling "trips". Higher trips beat lower trips, so 4-4-4 is better than 3-3-3.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Point</strong></dt>
		<dd>Rolling a pair, and another number, establishes the singleton as a "point". A higher point beats a lower point, so 2-2-6 is better than 5-5-2.</dd>
	<dt><strong>1-2-3</strong></dt>
		<dd>The lowest possible roll. If you roll a 1-2-3, you automatically lose.</dd>
