# 3 Dice Cee-Lo

## About

Cee-lo is a multiplayer gambling game played with three six-sided dice. The objective of the game is to roll the highest scoring combination relative to everyone else's rolls.

## Possible Outcomes

The order of possible outcomes from each dice roll are listed below from highest to lowest.

<dl>
	<dt>4-5-6</dt>
		<dd>The highest possible roll.</dd>
	<dt>Trips</dt>
		<dd>Rolling three of the same number is known as rolling "trips". Higher trips beat lower trips, so 4-4-4 is better than 3-3-3.</dd>
	<dt>Point</dt>
		<dd>Rolling a pair, and another number, establishes the singleton as a "point". A higher point beats a lower point, so 2-2-6 is better than 5-5-2.</dd>
	<dt>1-2-3</dt>
		<dd>The lowest possible roll. If you roll a 1-2-3, you automatically lose.</dd>
